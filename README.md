React Native app which uses Expo
# App is a game which aims to guess the number that the user has chosen in his/her mind
# App generates and displays a random number on the screen
# Under the generated number, two different prompts are provided: 
  1) If the number that the user has chosen is greater than the genarated number, user should click on the up arrow
  2) If the number that the user has chosen is smaller than the genarated number, user should click on the down arrow
# With regards to the user's input via clicking on arrows, a new random number is generated and user is asked to do the previous steps
# If the correct number is guessed and the correct number appears on the screen, the game finishes
